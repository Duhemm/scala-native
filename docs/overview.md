# Scala Native Overview

From a very high-level point of view, the pipeline for native compilation
looks like:

<img src="pipeline.png"/>

1. The compilation starts by processing of the original source files
   by the front-end compiler, followed by subsequent lowering and code
   generation to [Native IR (NIR)](nir.md). Details of front-end
   code generation are not covered in this document.

1. A nirpath (equivalent of classpath for nir) of nir compilation units
   is fed to the [Native Compiler (NC)](nc.md). Additionally,
   an entry point(s) are provided. NC computes the transitive closure of all
   classes, modules and interfaces recursively references from the specified
   entry points. Then, the result is lowered to the LLVM IR.

1. LLVM IR is compiled by the LLVM toolchain and linked with the
   [Native Runtime (NRT)](nrt.md).

## Native Compiler (NC)

The primary role of the native compiler is to translate all high-level features from
NIR to a combination of low-level features. After that emission of LLVM code is
trivial, as all low-level constructs map cleanly on corresponding LLVM primitives.

### Assumptions

The compiler assumes the following:

1. There is no dynamic code loading of any kind.
   Definitions that are not reachable may be dropped from the resulting LLVM IR.
   Methods which have not been overriden in the reachable set of classes are effectively final.

1. Resulting LLVM module is going to be linked with Native Runtime.

### Lowering passes

1. **Array lowering**. Translates arrays and operations on them.

1. **Interface lowering**. Translates interfaces and calls on interface methods.

1. **Module lowering**. Translates modules to top-level lazy vals with corresponding
   backing module class and accessor.

1. **Intrinsic lowering**. Maps intrinsic references to corresponding runtime implementation.

1. **Void lowering**. Translates away `unit` and `nothing` types to `void`.

1. **Object lowering**. Translates user-defined, built-in classes and `null` types.

1. **Size lowering**. Translates `size` operation and `size` type.

1. **Throw lowering**. Translates away `throw` instruction.


## Native Runtime (NRT)

NRT is a C library that provide an implementation of [garbage collector](gc.md)
and [intrinsics](intrinsics.md). We assume that LLVM bitcode of the runtime
implementation is available to enable inlining across runtime-application
boundary at link time.
